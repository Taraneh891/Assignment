# Assignment Project

This project reads in a text file, removes stop words (given as an input text file), removes all non-alphabetical text, stems words into their root form (using Porter Stemmer algorithm), computes the frequency of each term, and prints out the 20 most commonly occurring terms (not including stop words) in descending order of frequency. 

## Run Executable

To Run from the command line, use the following format:

```
Assignment.exe "<stopwords.txt path>" "<Text#.txt path>"
```
